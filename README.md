The deployable all-in-one bundle for [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet), a highly sophisticated proxy used for evading internet censorship or accessing websites in a controlled sandbox using the power of service-workers and more!

### HTTP Transport

The example uses [EpoxyTransport](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/EpoxyTransport) to fetch proxied data encrypted.

You may also want to use [CurlTransport](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/CurlTransport), a different way of fetching encrypted data, or [Bare-Client](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/Bare-as-module3), the legacy (unencrypted!) transport.

See the [bare-mux](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/bare-mux) documentation for more information.
